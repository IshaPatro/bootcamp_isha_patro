# NASDAQ Time Series Analysis Report

## Audience: Investment Portfolio Managers

### Audience Rationale
This report is designed specifically for investment portfolio managers who:
- Need data-driven insights to make tactical asset allocation decisions
- Have technical understanding of financial metrics and market indicators
- Require both visual representations and quantitative analysis
- Make decisions that directly impact portfolio performance and risk exposure

### Format Rationale
The executive report format with interactive Jupyter notebook was chosen because it:
1. **Combines narrative and technical elements** - Provides both high-level insights and detailed analysis in one document
2. **Supports visual decision-making** - Includes clear, annotated visualizations that highlight key patterns and relationships
3. **Enables sensitivity analysis** - Incorporates interactive elements that allow managers to understand how different scenarios might affect outcomes
4. **Maintains transparency** - Shows the underlying data and methodology, allowing for verification and deeper exploration
5. **Facilitates knowledge transfer** - Can be easily shared among team members and used for training purposes

The report structure progresses from descriptive analysis (what happened) to prescriptive recommendations (what actions to take), aligning with how portfolio managers typically approach decision-making processes.
